# Multimeter_ino

**A project to make a multimeter based on the arduino platform!**

- The Multimeter_ino can provide mesuarements of Voltage (AC/DC), Current (AC/DC), Capacitance, Resistance, Indutance and Frequency.

- If the problem is eletronics measurement, this is a cheap DIY solution!




**PROVIDED SCALES:**

 - [x] Voltage (AC/DC): 1, 10 and 100V
  
 - [x] Current (AC/DC): 1, 10 and 100mA
  
 - [x] Resistance: 10, 100 and 1000Ohm

 - [x] Capacitance: 10nF, 100nF, 1uF and 10uF

 - [x] Indutance: 10uH, 100H, 10mH and 100mH;

 - [x] Frequency: 10Hz, 100Hz and 1kHz
